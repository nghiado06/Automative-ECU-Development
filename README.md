# Automotive ECU Development with STM32F1 – AUTOSAR Style

## Introduction

Hi there! This repository documents my journey in developing embedded software on **STM32F1 microcontrollers**, with a focus on applying the **AUTOSAR Classic Platform architecture** – a widely adopted industry standard in the automotive domain.

The main objective of this repository is to implement **basic drivers** such as `IO Drivers`, `Communication Drivers`, etc., following **AUTOSAR-compliant software structure**. This includes naming conventions, layered architecture, separation of configuration/code/data, and adherence to professional embedded software development guidelines.

Unlike my previous work, which mainly involved register-level programming or the use of SPL, this project shifts towards building a **well-organized driver system** that is scalable and suitable for real-world ECU development.

I hope this repository will be helpful for those who are exploring AUTOSAR or aiming to practice **industry-grade programming techniques** on a widely-used platform like STM32F1.
